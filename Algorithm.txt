1. What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is an informal way of writing an algorithm using simple English words mixed with basic programming-like structures.
It is not a real programming language, so it does not follow strict syntax rules.
Its main purpose is to describe the logic of a program in a way that is easy to understand by humans.

2. Why and When Do We Use Pseudocode?
Why we use pseudocode:

To plan the solution before writing actual code

To understand the logic of an algorithm clearly

To make algorithms language-independent

To communicate ideas easily with others (students, teachers, team members)

To reduce errors before coding

When we use pseudocode:

Before starting to code a program

While designing an algorithm

During exams or assignments to explain logic

When learning programming concepts

When discussing solutions without choosing a programming language

3. How to Write Pseudocode to Represent an Algorithm?

There is no fixed standard, but good pseudocode usually follows these rules:

General Guidelines:

Write step-by-step instructions

Use simple and clear language

Capitalize keywords (optional but recommended)

Use indentation for loops and conditions

Avoid programming-specific syntax (like { } or ;)

Common Pseudocode Keywords:

START / END

INPUT / OUTPUT

IF / ELSE

WHILE / FOR

SET or ASSIGN

4. Example: Problem Algorithm Written in Pseudocode
Problem:

Write an algorithm to find the sum of two numbers.

Algorithm Explanation:

Start

Read two numbers

Add the numbers

Display the result

End

Pseudocode:
START
INPUT number1
INPUT number2
SET sum = number1 + number2
OUTPUT sum
END
