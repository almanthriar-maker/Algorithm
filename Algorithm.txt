1. What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is an informal way of writing an algorithm using simple English words mixed with basic programming-like structures.
It is not a real programming language, so it does not follow strict syntax rules.
Its main purpose is to describe the logic of a program in a way that is easy to understand by humans.

2. Why and When Do We Use Pseudocode?
Why we use pseudocode:

To plan the solution before writing actual code

To understand the logic of an algorithm clearly

To make algorithms language-independent

To communicate ideas easily with others (students, teachers, team members)

To reduce errors before coding

When we use pseudocode:

Before starting to code a program

While designing an algorithm

During exams or assignments to explain logic

When learning programming concepts

When discussing solutions without choosing a programming language

3. How to Write Pseudocode to Represent an Algorithm?

There is no fixed standard, but good pseudocode usually follows these rules:

General Guidelines:

Write step-by-step instructions

Use simple and clear language

Capitalize keywords (optional but recommended)

Use indentation for loops and conditions

Avoid programming-specific syntax (like { } or ;)

Common Pseudocode Keywords:

START / END

INPUT / OUTPUT

IF / ELSE

WHILE / FOR

SET or ASSIGN

4. Example: Problem Algorithm Written in Pseudocode
Problem:

Write an algorithm to find the sum of two numbers.

Algorithm Explanation:

Start

Read two numbers

Add the numbers

Display the result

End

Pseudocode:
START
INPUT number1
INPUT number2
SET sum = number1 + number2
OUTPUT sum
END



Task 1: Calculate Average
Algorithm Average (a,b)/2
input a,b
Average a+b/2
retutn Average
End Algotithm



Task 2:Check if a Number is Even or Odd
input number n
if number n MOD 2=0 THEN

return "Even"
Else
return "odd"
End if rule



Task 3: Find the Smallest Number in a List
START
INPUT n
INPUT list[1..n]

SET smallest = list[1]

FOR i = 2 TO n DO
    IF list[i] < smallest THEN
        SET smallest = list[i]
    END IF
END FOR

OUTPUT smallest
END

Task 4: Count Positive and Negative Numbers

START
INPUT n
INPUT list[1..n]

SET positive Count = 0
SET negativeCount = 0

FOR i = 1 TO n DO
    IF list[i] > 0 THEN
        positiveCount = positiveCount + 1
    ELSE IF list[i] < 0 THEN
        negativeCount = negativeCount + 1
    END IF
END FOR

OUTPUT positiveCount
OUTPUT negativeCount
END

Task 5: Remove Duplicates from a List

START
INPUT list

SET uniqueList = empty

FOR each number in list DO
    IF number NOT IN uniqueList THEN
        ADD number TO uniqueList
    END IF
END FOR

OUTPUT uniqueList
END

Task 6: Find All Prime Numbers Up to N

START
INPUT N

FOR number = 2 TO N DO
    SET isPrime = true

    FOR i = 2 TO number - 1 DO
        IF number MOD i = 0 THEN
            SET isPrime = false
        END IF
    END FOR

    IF isPrime = true THEN
        OUTPUT number
    END IF
END FOR

END

Task 7: Merge Two Sorted Lists

START
INPUT list1
INPUT list2

SET i = 1
SET j = 1
SET mergedList = empty

WHILE i <= length(list1) AND j <= length(list2) DO
    IF list1[i] < list2[j] THEN
        ADD list1[i] TO mergedList
        i = i + 1
    ELSE
        ADD list2[j] TO mergedList
        j = j + 1
    END IF
END WHILE

WHILE i <= length(list1) DO
    ADD list1[i] TO mergedList
    i = i + 1
END WHILE

WHILE j <= length(list2) DO
    ADD list2[j] TO mergedList
    j = j + 1
END WHILE

OUTPUT mergedList
END


Task 8: Find the Second Largest Number

START
INPUT list

IF list[1] > list[2] THEN
    SET largest = list[1]
    SET secondLargest = list[2]
ELSE
    SET largest = list[2]
    SET secondLargest = list[1]
END IF

FOR i = 3 TO length(list) DO
    IF list[i] > largest THEN
        SET secondLargest = largest
        SET largest = list[i]
    ELSE IF list[i] < largest AND list[i] > secondLargest THEN
        SET secondLargest = list[i]
    END IF
END FOR

OUTPUT secondLargest
END
